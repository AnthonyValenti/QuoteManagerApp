# Quote ManagerApp
IOS QuoteManager App
This summer to make some extra money my brother and I started a concrete/interlocking cleaning and sealing business, however we both realized that estiamting prices and keeping schedules of upcoming jobs was a very time consuming task. Thats when I hade the idea of creating my own Quote Manager app that could be used to instnatly calcualte jobs material costs and charge price based on our pre-determined squarefootage rates. After entering in the job's adress, square-footage and scheduled date, you can select the desired service from a scroll wheel and the material cost/charge price will be instnatly displayed and saved in an upcoming jobs list.
