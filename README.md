# Quote Manager App
This summer to make some extra money I started a concrete/interlocking cleaning and sealing business. To help with quoting and organizing jobs I had the idea of creating a quote manager app that could be used to instnatly calcualte material costs and charge price based on pre-determined squarefootage rates. After entering in the job's adress, square-footage and scheduled date, you can select the desired service from a scroll wheel and the material cost and charge price will be instnatly displayed and saved in an upcoming jobs list.
